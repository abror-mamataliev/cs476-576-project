## Abror

Abror was responsible for managing the Raspberry Pi and the cloud server. He implemented much of the communication logic between the Raspberry Pi, the edge device, and the cloud server, ensuring the components could communicate with each other and transfer the sample picture reliably.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed a Python/Flask server deployed on the Raspberry Pi
- Handled communication between different parts of the system
- Created an interface for sending and receiving data to the Raspberry Pi
- Set up the sample Docker image and deployed it across the different parts of the project

## Dhruv

Dhruv improved the final output formatting of `simulate.py` so that the output is neat and easily readable for the user.

**Key Contributions:**
- Decided that the sample workload within the Docker image should be a simple image recognition program
- Helped implement the image recognition program
- Communicated with the professor regarding technical details
- Created the presentation slides for the project 
    
## Jackson

Jackson worked on the initial planning for the project by helping define the project's problem statement and solution statement, and mapping out how the edge, cloud, and orchestration pieces would fit together.

**Key Contributions:**
- Clarified project specifications, requirements and details with the professor
- Worked on implementing the orchestration script (`simulate.py`) on the edge device/user's machine
- Helped establish the overall project architecture
