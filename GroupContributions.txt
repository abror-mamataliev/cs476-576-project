Abror:
    
    Abror was responsible for managing the Raspberry Pi and the cloud server. He implemented much of the communication logic between 
    the Raspberry Pi, the edge device, and the cloud server, ensuring the components could communicate with eachother and transfer 
    the sample picture reliably. Specifically, he developed a Python/Flask server that is deployed on the Raspberry Pi that handled 
    the communication between the other parts of the system, creating an interface for sending and receiving data to the Raspberry Pi.
    Additionally, he set up the sample Docker image and deployed it across the different parts of the project.

Dhruv:

    Dhruv improved the final output formatting of simulate.py so that the output is neat and easily readable for the user. 
    He also helped decide that the sample workload within the Docker image should be a simple image recognition program, 
    he then also helped to implement the program, and communicated with the professor regarding technical details regarding the program.
    Finally, he created the presentation slides for the project. 
    
Jackson:

    Jackson worked on the initial planning for the project by helping define the project’s problem statement and solution statement, 
    and mapping out how the edge, cloud, and orchestration pieces would fit together. He also clarified project specifications, 
    requirements and details with the professor. Lastly, he worked on implementing the orchestation script (simulate.py) on the edge 
    device/users machine.
